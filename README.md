#  SEMANTIC: Systematic Evaluation of Multi-class Article News-Text Identification and Categorization
SEMANTIC is a project focused on automating the multi-class classification of news articles using machine learning. By leveraging both traditional models and advanced NLP techniques like CNNs and BERT, it addresses key challenges such as class imbalance and varied article lengths. Using an IAB-categorized dataset, SEMANTIC aims to improve contextual understanding and accurate categorization of diverse news content.

## Project Overview
This project, SEMANTIC, focuses on the systematic evaluation of multi-class classification models for categorizing news articles. We explore the use of traditional and deep learning models, emphasizing the challenges of class imbalance and variable-length articles, with a dataset categorized under the IAB taxonomy.

## Key Features
Multi-class Classification: Classify news articles into categories based on IAB standards.
Imbalance Handling: Techniques to address imbalanced classes.
Contextual Embedding Models: Utilization of Word2Vec and BERT for improved semantic understanding.

## Dataset
This project leverages a labeled dataset from HuggingFace containing IAB-categorized news articles. The dataset presents challenges due to:

1. **Class Imbalance**: Some categories have significantly fewer articles.
2. **Variable Article Lengths**: Articles range from a few hundred to thousands of characters.
